Once the Start button is pressed, a timer will start and the user will be asked a series of 4 questions. If the user answers wrong, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer. However many seconds are left once the user is done answering every question is the user's final score.

The score can then be saved to a High Score list and viewed on the "View Highscores!" page by clicking the item in the navbar.
